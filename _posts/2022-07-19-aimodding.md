## AI Modding  
1. Go to your extracted game pak, enter `.../ReadyOrNot/Config/â€¦`, and open `AILevelData.ini`.
2. Edit the `AILevelData.ini` file however you would like.
3. Create a new pakchunk mod folder, just as you would with any other mod. However, make sure to add `_P` to the end of the folder name. Inside that folder, create the directory `Config`, and put your `AILevelData.ini` file inside. 
4. Pak the mod.

Alternatively, you may use [this website](https://ron.recursiveprojects.cloud) to generate the mods for you.
