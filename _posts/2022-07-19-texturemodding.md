## Texture Modding

### Texture Replacement  
Texture replacement is the easiest to mod. An example can be found in [Example Mod](https://unofficial-modding-guide.com/posts/thebasics). If you are doing more than recoloring, you will also need to edit the normal and ORM maps.
1. When ripping files from the game, look for files that contain `T_`, `BaseColor`, `_B`, as these files are usually the texture files. 
2. Modify the texture however you would like with GIMP, Photoshop, or any other image editing software. You can also use Substance Painter, and doing such will make texturing much easier. 
3. As with overriding any other object from the game, make sure to replicate the location of the texture. If you don’t, the changes won’t apply.
4. Create a .pak file, and everything should work properly.
